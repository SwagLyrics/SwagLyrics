# SwagLyrics - Main Repository

SwagLyrics fetches the currently playing song from Spotify on Windows, Linux and macOS and displays the lyrics in the command-line or in a browser tab.
Refreshes automatically when song changes. The lyrics are fetched from Genius. There is server-side issue handling so that all songs that have lyrics on Genius can be supported.

The `SwagLyrics-For-Spotify` repository contains code for the Python Package and the `swaglyrics-issue-maker` has the server-side code necessary to handle issues.

This repository is meant for centralizing issues and enhancement proposals, as well as documentation on how to install and run SwagLyrics on different platforms.
